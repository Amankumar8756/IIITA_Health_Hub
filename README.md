 
#  IIITA_Health_Hub Doctor Appointment Booking System

A full-stack web application built with the MERN stack to streamline doctor appointment scheduling for the Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad (IIITA) Health Center. Students can register, log in, book and manage appointments with on-campus doctors, while admins and doctors oversee schedules, patient data, and health center operations.
